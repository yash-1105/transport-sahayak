# 1x weight) instead of the singular "car" (which is literally that record's entire subType,

# testing that the identical failure mode reproduces with an English paraphrase ("Two cars
# collided...now there is a fire" -> also wrong before some phrasings dodge it by luck), so this
# was never Hindi-exclusive -- it was corpus-vocabulary-specific, just consistently exposed by
